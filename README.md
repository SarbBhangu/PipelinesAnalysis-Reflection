1. The “Why”
- The most important business reason to use CI/CD is to reduce human error and save time during releases

2. The “How”
- Continuous Integration automatically tests and merges code whenever changes are pushed. Continuous Deployment begins after CI passes and automatically deploys the code to production.

3. Tool Comparison
- GitHub Actions is the best choice for a small, budget-conscious startup already using GitHub.

4. Flexibility vs. Simplicity
- Jenkins is a better choice when a team needs very customized build and deployment steps. This is helpful for large systems that use special tools or servers.

5. Personal Connection
- In my projects, I had to update and restart the app by hand. CI/CD could do this automatically for me.
