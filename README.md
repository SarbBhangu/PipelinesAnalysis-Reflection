2. The “How”

- Continuous Integration automatically tests and merges code whenever changes are pushed.

- This helps catch bugs early before they reach production.

- Continuous Deployment begins after CI passes and automatically deploys the code to production.

- CI ends when the code is verified as stable, and CD begins when that verified code is released to users without manual steps.

3. Tool Comparison

- GitHub Actions is the best choice for a small, budget-conscious startup already using GitHub.

- It is easy to set up and works directly within the GitHub - repository.

- There is no need to manage extra servers or infrastructure.

- This makes it cost-effective while still providing powerful automation features.

4. Flexibility vs. Simplicity

- Jenkins is a better choice when a team needs very customized build and deployment steps.

- It is useful for large systems that require special tools or complex workflows.

- While Jenkins requires more maintenance, its flexibility can be valuable for advanced enterprise environments.

5. Personal Connection

- In my projects, I had to manually pull code, install dependencies, and restart the app by hand.

- This process was time-consuming and easy to mess up.

- CI/CD could do this automatically for me, making deployments faster, more reliable, and less stressful.
